# Digit-Recognizer-using-CNN
## About
The project was build inorder to recognize the digits (0-9). The application contains two csv files namely train.csv and test.csv<br>
<strong>train.csv</strong> contains 42000 rows x 785 columns. First column contains the label of the digit and the next 784 columns contains each pixel value of the digit.<br>
<strong>test.csv</strong> contains 28000 rows Ã— 784 columns. It contains only the pixel columns of the digit for testing purpose.<br>
Each image is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width.<br>
Each pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel, with higher numbers meaning darker. This pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255, inclusive.<br>
The dataset was obtained from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data)
## Layers:
1. First Convolution Layer
    * No. of filters = 32
    * Filter lengh = (3,3)
    * Activation = relu
    * input_shape = (28, 28, 1)
2. First Pooling layer
    * pool_size = (2, 2)
3. Second Convolution Layer
    * No. of filters = 32
    * Filter lengh = (3,3)
    * Activation = relu
4. Second Pooling layer
    * pool_size = (2, 2)
5. Flatten layer
6. First Fully Connected Layer
    * kernel_initializer = uniform
    * Activation = relu 
    * units=100
7. Output layer
    * kernel_initializer = uniform
    * Activation = softmax
    * units=10
